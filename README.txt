RjDj's "rj" Pure Data abstraction library in it's own repository without all the other cruft.

You can use this by adding it to your path in patches by instantiating: [declare -path ./rjlib/rj/] after adding it as a git submodule.

The original with example scenes, externals, etc. is here: https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib
